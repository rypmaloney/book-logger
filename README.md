# Book Catalog


This project is a way to catalog books you've read or intend to read. Create an entry by filling out a form. The form creates book object in a library array. The library array is displayed as a table. You can update the read/unread status of the book or remove it entirely from the table.

The catalog is stored with local storage. 

This project was a nice warmup for object constructors and arrays of objects.
